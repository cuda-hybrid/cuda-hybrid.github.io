Customizing Node Values
===================================================================================================================

For the previous use case, the model is automatically generated by the package, where each concept of the FCM is randomly assigned
a value between 0 and 1. However, in some cases, concepts might have different distributions or have different ways of being
generated. This tutorial will show how to use the package in such cases by first illustrating how to create a customized ABM/FCM graph
and then demonstrating how to use that graph with the package in both serial and parallel.

This model used here is based on the model in the paper *Modelling the Joint Effect of Social Determinants and Peers on Obesity Among Canadian Adults* [#f1]_.
In the paper, a hybrid ABM/FCM model was used to assess
how social network structures and the knowledge shared within them play a role in preventing obesity among Canadian adults.
Four different types of networks and different values for probability of accepting good knowledge (**p**) were used, 
to show how knowledge and social networks can affect the average obesity rate.
However, in this tutorial, only the **small world network** and **p** of **0.5** will be utilized. 
These values can easily be changed by passing different arguments, which will be discussed in later steps.

Creating a custom graph
-----------------------

FCM
~~~

For the FCM model, an instance of networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraph will need to be created, and each node must have an attribute ``'val'``,
so the node values can be accessed as followed: ``graph.nodes['node_name']['val']``

There 13 concepts with 20 edges in this specific use case. The relationships between the concepts and their weights are given in
in the graph below:

..  image:: ../img/conceptMap.gif

These edges are put in to a text file and the initial graph is created using ``networkx.read_edgelist()``:

..  code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx

    FCM = nx.read_edgelist('obesity.txt', nodetype=str, data=(('weight', float),), create_using=nx.DiGraph())



Each node will then be assigned an attribute ``'val'`` that has the node value.
Since each concept of the model will be generated in a different way (more details can be found in the paper), the ``val``
attribute can be added as below for each node:

..  code-block:: python

    FCM.nodes["Fatness_Perceived_as_Negative"]["val"] = 0.8
    FCM.nodes["Exercise"]["val"] = np.random.wald(1, 0.01)

Every agent will have the same FCM graph, so all code above can be put into one function called ``create_obesity_FCM()``:

..  code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import networkx as nx

    AGE_RELATED = np.loadtxt('age_related.txt')
    INCOME = np.loadtxt('income.txt')

    def create_obesity_FCM():
        FCM = nx.read_edgelist('obesity.txt', nodetype=str, data=(('weight', float),), create_using=nx.DiGraph())
        # Fatness_Perceived_as_Negative and Belief_in_Personal_Responsibility will both start at 0.8
        FCM.nodes["Fatness_Perceived_as_Negative"]["val"] = 0.8
        FCM.nodes["Belief_in_Personal_Responsibility"]["val"] = 0.8
        # Exercise has inverse gaussian distribution with mu of 1 and lambda of 0.01
        FCM.nodes["Exercise"]["val"] = np.random.wald(1, 0.01)
        # Food_Intake is around 0.0027 more than Exercise
        FCM.nodes["Food_Intake"]["val"] = FCM.nodes["Exercise"]["val"] + 30.0/11000.0
        # Knowledge has inverse gaussian distribution with mu of 1 and lambda of 0.01
        FCM.nodes["Knowledge"]["val"] = np.random.wald(1, 0.01)
        # Income is randomly assigned based on the distribution from income.txt
        FCM.nodes["Income"]["val"] = np.random.choice(INCOME[:, 0], p = INCOME[:, 1]/100)
        # Age-related concepts. Each age will have a different distribution for Stress, Depression, etc.
        # These information are stored in age_related.txt
        ageInd = int(np.random.choice(AGE_RELATED[:, 0], p = AGE_RELATED[:, 1]/100) - 18)
        FCM.nodes["Age"]["val"] = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][2]
        propStressed = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][4] / 100
        FCM.nodes["Stress"]["val"] = np.random.choice([1, 0], p = [1-propStressed, propStressed])
        propDepressed = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][3] / 100
        FCM.nodes["Depression"]["val"] = np.random.choice([0, 1], p = [1-propDepressed, propDepressed])
        FCM.nodes["Antidepressants"]["val"] = 0
        if FCM.nodes["Depression"]["val"] == 1:
            propAnti = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][5] / 100
            FCM.nodes["Antidepressants"]["val"] = np.random.choice([0, 1], p = [1-propAnti, propAnti])
        propHealth = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][9] / 100
        FCM.nodes["Physical_Health"]["val"] = np.random.choice([0, 1], p = [1-propHealth, propHealth])
        probObesity = AGE_RELATED[ageInd][6:9] / 100
        # Obesity [0, 0.5, 1] for normal, medium, obese
        FCM.nodes["Obesity"]["val"] = np.random.choice([0, 0.5, 1], p = probObesity)
        # Weight_Discrimination is the same as Obesity
        FCM.nodes["Weight_Discrimination"]["val"] = FCM.nodes["Obesity"]["val"]
        return FCM

ABM
~~~

After having a function to create an FCM for each agent, an instance of ``networkx.classes.graph.Graph`` will be used for the ABM.
The type of graph will depend on the model.
Each agent, however, must have an ``'FCM'`` attribute that stores its FCM graph for the package to function correctly.
The FCM graph can the be accessed by ``abm_graph.nodes[agent]["FCM"]``.

As mentioned above, the simulation will be run with a small world network, so  ``networkx.watts_strogatz_graph()`` function
is used here. Every agent will then get its own FCM graph by using ``create_obesity_FCM``. The completed ABM/FCM graph will
be passed as an argument to the constructor of the HybridModel to be used with the package:

..  code-block:: python

    import cuda_hybrid as ch
    # Same number of nodes and degree as indicated in the paper
    G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(2412, 11, 0.05)
    for agent in G.nodes():
            G.nodes[agent]["FCM"] = create_obesity_FCM()
    hm = ch.HybridModel(G)

Running the simulation without communities
------------------------------------------

Running the simulation with a custom graph using the package is the same as running the simulation with a graph generated by
:func:`create_graph<cuda_hybrid.create_graph>` or :func:`generate_model<cuda_hybrid.generate_model>`.

..  note::

    For more details about serial run, refer to :ref:`the serial use case<Serial>`.

    For more details about parallel run, refer to :ref:`the parallel use case<Parallel>`.

In the paper, the simulation will be repeated for 10 times, each time for 20 steps. At every time step, each agent will only
interact with one neighbor at random, and only the knowledge concept of the agents will participate in the interaction. If the value of the knowledge concept 
from the influencing agent is greater than that of the influenced agent, the influenced agent will have ``p`` probability
to accept the knowledge from the influencing agent and, thus, take on the same value, 
while if it is smaller, the probability of accepting is ``1- p``. (More details about the interaction
between agents can be found in the paper).

In Serial
~~~~~~~~~
The interaction function is provided below. It takes two arguments, **HybridModel** and the probability **p**, which
will be 0.5 in this case (as mentioned above). However, the value of p can be changed to anything between 0 and 1.
At the end the simulation is run using :func:`run_serial<cuda_hybrid.run_serial>`:

..  code-block:: python

    def knowledge_influence(influenced, influencing, prob):
        choices = np.array([influenced, influencing])
        weights = [1.0,0.0]
        if influencing > influenced:
            weights = [1.0-prob, prob]
        elif influencing < influenced:
            weights = [prob, 1.0-prob]
        return np.random.choice(choices, p=weights)

    def obesity_interact(hm, p):
        if hm.ABM_adj.shape[0] <= 1:
            return
        # loop through each agent
        for agent in range(hm.ABM_adj.shape[0]):
            # grab the neighbors
            neighbors = hm.get_neighbors(agent)
            if len(neighbors) != 0:
                friend = np.random.choice(hm.get_neighbors(agent))
                # get the numeric index for EconomicDevelopment and AbilityOfInsurgentsToControlThePopulation
                knowledgeIdx = hm.fcm_labels["Knowledge"]
                # agents now influence each other
                hm.node_future_val[agent][knowledgeIdx] = knowledge_influence(
                    hm.node_val[agent][knowledgeIdx], hm.node_val[friend][knowledgeIdx], p
                )

    print(hm.run_serial(["Obesity", "Physical_Health"], [0.05, 0.05], 10, obesity_interact, [hm, 0.5], 20)['Obesity'])
    
The average value of obesity is ``0.926966175``.

In Parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interaction function ``f`` is provided below:

..  code-block:: python
    
    @cuda.jit()
    def f(agents, neighbors, node_val, node_future_val, knowledgeIdx, prob, randoms):
        x = cuda.grid(1)
        if x < agents:
        agent = int(x)
        friend = neighbors[agent]
        influenced = node_val[agent][knowledgeIdx]
        influencing = node_val[friend][knowledgeIdx]
        if influencing > influenced:
            if randoms[agent] < prob:
                node_future_val[agent][knowledgeIdx] = influencing
        elif influencing < influenced:
            if randoms[agent] < 1 - prob:
            node_future_val[agent][knowledgeIdx] = influencing

The above function is called from  the obesity_interact function. Since cuda function cannot be passed as an argument,
another wrapper function will be required in order to run the interaction in parallel:

..  code-block:: python
    
    def obesity_interact(hm, p):
        TPB = (1024, 1)
        blockspergrid_x = math.ceil(hm.ABM_adj.shape[0] / TPB[0])
        BPG = (blockspergrid_x, 1)

        # Pre-select the neighbor that each agent will interact with
        neighbors = np.zeros(len(hm.neighbors))
        for i in range(len(neighbors)):
            neighbors[i] = np.random.choice(hm.neighbors[i])
        neighbors = np.array(neighbors, dtype=int)

        agents = hm.ABM_adj.shape[0]
        cu_neighbors = cuda.to_device(neighbors)
        knowledgeIdx = hm.fcm_labels["Knowledge"]
        randoms = np.random.uniform(size=len(neighbors))
        cu_randoms = cuda.to_device(randoms)
        f[TPB, BPG](agents, cu_neighbors, hm.node_val, hm.node_future_val, knowledgeIdx, p, cu_randoms)

..  warning::

    Like in the previous parallel use case, every function that is used on the GPU should have the  ``@cuda.jit()`` decoration.
    There should be another function that wraps the cuda function so that it can be passed to the model. This also allows
    a serial interaction function to be passed.

After that, arguments, including the hybrid model, a list of focus nodes, a list of thresholds for the focus nodes,
the maximum number of iterations, a list of arguments for function f, and, optionally, the number of steps, 
will be passed to the cuda_main function to run the simulation. In the paper, the simulation was run for 20 steps, so
the same thing is being done here:

..  code-block:: python

    print(hm.run_parallel(["Obesity", "Physical_Health"], [.05, .05], 10, obesity_interact, [hm, p], 20)["Obesity"])


The average value of obesity is ``0.928425923``.

Visualization
-----------------------

The model can be run with different values of p, and the results for the average value for the Obesity concept
after 10 replications with two different networks, small world network and scale-free network, are displayed below:
