Welcome!
========

This package is designed to speed up the process of running simulations with ABM/FCM hybrid models. It uses CUDA cores
to parallelizing the process of stabilizing FCM models by offloading the calculation to a GPU. This package provides
a default way to create models, but also allows the flexibility for users to customize their own graphs. Users can
run the simulations both in serially and parallel. The set up for these two versions are slightly different and
will be addressed in the tutorials below.
